In this session we are going to understand the basic layout of the Unikraft working directory, its environment variables, as well as what the most common Unikraft specific files mean. We are also going to take a look at how we can build basic applications and how we can extend their functionality and support by adding ported external libraries.

Before everything, let’s take a bird’s eye view of what Unikraft is and what we can do with it. Unikraft is a unikernel SDK, meaning it offers you the blocks (source code, configuration and build system, runtime support) to build and run unikernels. A unikernel is a single image file that can be loaded and run as a separate running instance, most often a virtual machine.
